# Titanic-Project
The Titanic is a classical example of supervised machine learning task. Thus in this analysis, our goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question "what people were more distinctly probable to survive than others?" This is a beginner friendly project for any new to the field of data science.
We used the logistic regression algorithm and model provided within the Scikit-learn library in our analysis to build the model that predicted those that survived to  those that did not survive using passenger data like :name, age, gender, socio-economic class, fare etc.
In this analysis, we had our codes outlined in four sections where we extensively completed an end-to-end project on the titanic data set. In this Machine Learning study, we achieved at least 80% accuracy in predicting the survival (y-varaible or label feature) distribution of the Titanic disaster based on the demographic data testing notebook by the logistic regression algorithms model.

**About the Dataset.**
The dataset was taken from Kaggle, an online open source repository. It contains information about the passengers on board the Titanic. This information included passenger Name, Age, Gender, Passenger class, Fare, Number of siblings/spouses aboard and Whether they survived or not and amongst others. 

**Project Goals**
**My main goals were:**
- Understanding the relationship between the passenger features and the survival feature.
- Exploratory data analysis and performing some data cleaning. 
- Build a basic machine learning model to predict survival feature (column) of the data.
- 
**Process Taken**
- Importing relevant libraries for the analysis.
- Uploading and reading the Dataset.
- Dataset Overview (Using the .head() function).
- Exploratory Data Analysis; Summary Statistics ( statistics on counts, mean, std, minimum and maximum values, the 3 percentiles).
- Data Cleaning; Handling Missing Values and duplicates if any.
- Visualizations of relevant features to check their relationship with the target feature.
- Choosing the Best Model ( Logistic regression model)

**Tools I Used For The Analysis**
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualization
- Scikit-learn for building models
- Jupyter Notebook for the entire analysis

**Certain Insights from the Analysis**
Some insights I found from my exploratory data analysis (EDA):
- Women were more likely to survive: Gender played a huge role in survival
- First-class passengers had better chances: Wealth mattered
- Children had higher survival rates than adults
- Passengers with many family members aboard had mixed outcomes

**What I Learned**
- Data preprocessing  and exploratory data analysis matters more than modeling
- Visualization helps uncover hidden patterns
- Even simple models can give wonderful insights
- Real-world datasets have imperfections and defects but that is totally fine but a good analyst should always find a way of handling these inperfections.
